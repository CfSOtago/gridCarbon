# gridCarbon
Code to analyse the carbon footprint of NZ electricity generation over time.

Inspired by:

 * [Staffell 2017](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516307017) (UK analysis)
 * [Khan et al, 2018](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652618306474) (NZ Analysis)

Started out as part of a CfS summer student scholarship project and has evolved into something slightly larger and more complicated :-)
